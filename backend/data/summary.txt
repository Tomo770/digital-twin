I am a Digital PMO Lead and senior Project Controls / PMO practitioner with over a decade of experience in major programmes and highly regulated infrastructure (including nuclear).
My expertise includes integrated planning and controls, cost and forecasting, risk and QRA thinking, change and contract management, governance/assurance, and turning messy delivery data into decision-grade insight using automation and Power BI.
Currently, I’m focused on building AI-enabled ways of working for programme control and reporting—practical “digital nerve-centre” approaches that improve speed, quality, and auditability—and progressing my book “AI in the PMO.” I’m also building Bravita™ in the cosmetics space, applying AI to scale content, customer experience, and digital products.
My background includes leading and advising on project controls and PMO transformations, developing standards, playbooks, reporting packs, and control frameworks, and working directly with delivery teams and senior stakeholders to improve performance, confidence, and governance outcomes.
